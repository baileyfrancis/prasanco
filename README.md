PrAsAnCo (Prokaryotic Assembly Annotation and Comparison) is a complete toolkit designed specifically for prokaryotic genome assembly, annotation and comparison for two input datasets. PrAsAnCo uses both short-read Illumina data and long-read Oxford Nanopore data to generate a polished assembly for both input samples.
